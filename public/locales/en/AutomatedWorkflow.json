To create an elastic template, we must provide a document for the user to read and agree to, a name for the elastic template, and we must define <code>display_settings</code> to control what the UI experience will look like. The elastic template is created using <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/reference/accounts/clickwraps/createclickwrap/'>ClickWraps:createClickwrap</a>. Then we must activate the elastic template before use with <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/reference/accounts/clickwraps/updateclickwrapversion/'>ClickWraps:updateClickwrapVersion</a> by updating the elastic template and setting the status to <code>active</code>.</p><h5>Step 2</h5><p>Using the ID of the elastic template created in the previous step, we display the elastic template using a JavaScript API call to the <code>docuSignClick.Clickwrap.render()</code> method. Required arguments include <code>clickwrap_environment</code>, which is <code>https://demo.docusign.net</code> for the development environment; <code>clickwrap_account_id</code>, which is the account ID for the preconfigured DocuSign developer account; <code>clickwrap_id</code>, which we obtain in the previous step; and <code>client_user_id</code>, which is created in the app session. To make this client-side API call, the code needs to include https://demo.docusign.net/clickapi/sdk/latest/docusign-click.js on the page as a script element.</p><h5>Step 3</h5><p>View source file <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/docusign/sample-app-myconnectwebhook-ruby/blob/main/app/controllers/api/docusign/trigger_controller.rb#L35'>trigger_controller.rb</a> on GitHub.</p><p>Once the user accepts or declines the elastic signing agreement, we wait for a DocuSign Connect notification to tell us what action was taken. If we receive a <code>click-agreed</code> notification, we can start the next step of the example workflow, otherwise the workflow ends at this step. The screenshot below shows the events to which we subscribe in our custom Connect configuration in the preconfigured account.</p> <p><img width='600px' src='/images/click_connect_config.png' alt='click connect configuration' /></p><h5>Step 4</h5><p>View source code <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://github.com/docusign/sample-app-myconnectwebhook-ruby/blob/main/app/services/e_sign/send_envelope_service.rb'>send_envelope_service.rb</a> on GitHub.</p> <p>After receiving the <code>click-agreed</code> notification, we use the DocuSign eSignature REST API to create an envelope with <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href='https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/'>Envelopes:create</a>. In the envelope definition, we include a recipient with the information submitted by the user, a sample purchase confirmation document, and tabs. We set the envelope definition status to <code>sent</code> so that the envelope is sent immediately when we make our API call.</p>"
