# Ruby on Rails and React: MyConnectWebhook Sample Application

### Github repo: MyConnectWebhookSampleApp

## Introduction
MyConnectWebhook is a DocuSign sample application written in Ruby on Rails (server) and React (client). You can find a live instance running at [https://myconnectwebhook.sampleapps.docusign.com/](https://myconnectwebhook.sampleapps.docusign.com/).

MyConnectWebhook demonstrates the following:

1. **Authentication** with DocuSign via [JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api/guides/authentication/oauth2-jsonwebtoken).
2. **Bulk Sending Multiple Envelopes:** ([Source](./app/services/e_sign/bulk_sending_envelopes_service.rb))
   This example uses the DocuSign [eSignature REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api) to [Bulk Send](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/bulkenvelopes/bulksend/) multiple envelopes based on PDF document template, and filling data dynamically.
3. **Tracking User Signing Progress with Docusign Connect feature.** After the request has been sent to Docusign, the app awaits for webhook requests from [Docusign Connect](https://developers.docusign.com/platform/webhooks/connect/) and displays the result on UI.
4. **Signing Clickwrap Document:** ([Source](./app/javascript/src/pages/automatedWorkflow/index.js))
   This example demonstates signing process of DocuSign [Clickwrap](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/click-api/how-to/create-clickwraps/) document.
5. **Sending out Confirmation Envelope after Successful Clickwrap Signature:** ([Source](./app/services/e_sign/send_envelope_service.rb))
   This example uses the DocuSign [eSignature REST API](https://developers.docusign.com/esign-rest-api), demonstrating how to [crete an envelope](https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/envelopes/envelopes/create/). The example sends an envelope based on PDF template.

## Prerequisites

* A DocuSign developer account. Create a [free account](https://go.docusign.com/o/sandbox/).
* A DocuSign integration key (client ID) that is configured to use JSON Web Token (JWT) Grant.
  You will need the **integration key** itself and its **RSA key pair**. Copy your **RSA key pair** into a file in your config folder `config/docusign_private_key.txt`. You must also add your application's **Redirect URI** to your integration key. To run the app locally, this should be "http://localhost:3000/auth/docusign/callback". This [**video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgDqa7-L0yo) demonstrates how to create an integration key (client ID) for a user application like this example.
* [Ruby 3.1.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v16+

### Required variables for `config/appsettings.yml`

* **app_url** - http://localhost:3000
* **jwt_integration_key** - this jwt_integration_key can have the same value as the above integration_key
* **impersonated_user_guid** - Your User ID
* **signer_email** - Your API account Email
* **signer_name** - Your API account Name
* **authorization_server** - https://account-d.docusign.com for the development environment
* **aud** - `account-d.docusign.com` for the development environment


## Setup your custom DocuSign Connect configuration

### Using a ruby script
The ruby script included with this project sets up a custom Connect configuration with the same settings that the hosted app uses at https://myconnectwebhook.sampleapps.docusign.com. You'll need to provide a name for your new custom connect configuration as well as the URL to publish which, if running locally using ngrok, should follow the format `https://{YOUR_NGROK_HOST}.ngrok.io/api/docusign/trigger/do_process.json`.

* Navigate to the root folder of the app
  ```
  cd sample-app-myconnectwebhook-ruby
  ```
* Run the ruby script `create_connect_configuration.rb`
  ```
  ruby create_connect_configuration.rb
  ```
* Provide the name and URL to publish for your connect configuration when prompted.
* Check https://admindemo.docusign.com/connect to view or edit your new custom Connect configuration!

### Using the DocuSign UI
* Visit https://admindemo.docusign.com/connect
* Select "ADD CONFIGURATION" --> "Custom"
* Add a name for your custom Connect configuration
* In the `URL to Publish` field enter `https://{YOUR_NGROK_HOST}.ngrok.io/api/docusign/trigger/do_process.json`. This will allow Connect to send request to your local environment.
* subscribe to the events you wish your app to receive notifications for. Events for this app include

Envelope and Recipients:
  * Envelope Sent
  * Envelope Delivered
  * Recipient Auto Responded
  * Recipient Signed/Completed
  * Recipient Declined
  * Recipient Finish Later

  Include Data:
  * Custom Fields
  * Recipients

DocuSign Click:
  * Click Agreed
  * Click Declined

* Select "Enable Mutual TLS"
* "SAVE CONFIGURATION"

## Installation steps

**NOTE:** The first time you run the app with a new client id, you must grant consent for the application to perform actions on behalf of the user. Fill in your integration key and redirect url to the following consent url template and visit https://account-d.docusign.com/oauth/auth?response_type=code&scope=signature+impersonation+click.manage+click.send&client_id=#{jwt_integration_key}&redirect_uri=#{redirect_uri} to grant consent.
